## Acknowledgments
###Based on WPSE post
>####[**How to Sort the Favorites Plugins Screen Alphabetically?**](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/q/76643/12615)

>> *When viewing the Favorites Plugins tab, `/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=favorites`, 
the list comes unordered, is it possible to sort it from A to Z?*

>>![original favorites](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0DyUr.png)

>> *The problem is that the API doesn't offer an ordered query, 
so we can only sort each page results. 
The solution is to increase the number of items per page 
until no paging is necessary. The default limit is 30 plugins.*

### Embedded plugin
FPS has the plugin [**Install Via URL**](http://wordpress.org/plugins/upload-theme-via-url/) embedded into it. 
So, after <kbd>Favorites</kbd>, now there's a <kbd>URL</kbd> tab, 
to allow uploads via URL (for themes and plugins).

### Plugin updates
Native WordPress updates from GitHub using [***YahnisElsts / plugin-update-checker***](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker).
